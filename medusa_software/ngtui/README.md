# ngTUI

ngTUI (sometimes referred to as Rome) is a subcomponent of the Medusa Project to
write a modern C++ TUI framework based on `ncurses`.

## Why?
`ncurses`/`curses` is a great framework, but in my (spv) opinion, it feels a bit
ancient compared to what could be done with, say, C++. It's a bit low-level, and
the code you write with it is, in my opinion, not the best-looking, to put it
mildly.
