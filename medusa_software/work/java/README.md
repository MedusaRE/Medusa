# Medusa Java Work

I (spv) don't know yet how much of the Medusa project will be written in Java,
but I'm considering it, as I started a class on Java, and I'm learning that I
don't hate the language as much as I thought.

As with C++ before it (yes, I used to be a ***massive*** C++ hater), I don't
hate the language, I hate how some use the language.
