# Paris
Paris is a subcomponent of the Medusa Project to develop the client/server
architecture that is intended to be used in the project.

Medusa is meant to be modeled after a client/server architecture, where \[a]
machine (or machines) operate\[s] the server(s), and handle the bulk of the
processing work; and \[a] machine (or machines) run\[s] \[a] client(s), which
connect\[s] to the server, and provide\[s] a user interface to utilize the server.

The server can be the same machine as the client, and it does not need to be
over the network (i.e. TCP), it could be a socket, for example.
