# MPI
The MPI (sometimes referred to as Paris) is a subcomponent of the Medusa Project
to develop the client/server architecture that is intended to be used in the
project.

Medusa is meant to be modeled after a client/server architecture, where a
machine (or machines) operates the server, and handle the bulk of the
processing work; and a machine (or machines) runs a client, which
connects to the server, and provides a UI to interface with the server.

The server can be the same machine as the client, and it does not need to be
over the network (i.e. TCP), it could be a socket, for example.
