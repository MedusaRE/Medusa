# Medusa Project Goals

The goals of the [Medusa Project](https://medusa-re.org) are to create a
community-developed suite of tools for software and hardware research, such as
low-level development, debugging, emulation, and higher-level development, such
as software development for operating systems like Windows, macOS, or GNU/Linux.
