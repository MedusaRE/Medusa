Hello! Welcome to a Work-In-Progress (WIP) wiki for the
[Medusa Project](https://medusa-re.org).

The Medusa Project is a project to create a free (libre) community-developed
suite of tools for general software and hardware research, such as low-level
development, debugging, emulation, and higher-level development, such as
software development for operating systems like Windows, macOS, or GNU/Linux.
