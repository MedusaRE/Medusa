Planning

I think the goal for libxpdbg will be to have a centralized API for machine
control and such. Trying to figure out how to structure the API though.

I will probably structure it in a rather object-oriented fashion, i.e. you will
create a blank machine object, then populate the blank object with a machine
definition. For example, a machine definition could contain a description of
the hardware of a Commodore 64. Include a (or specify a builtin) emulator for
the 6502, SID, etc, provide the framebuffer, etc. Then, you could create a blank
machine, then populate it with that C64 machine definition, and load a ROM of
the C64's builtin "OS", or what have you.

Or, a machine definition could contain a description of the hardware of a
TI-84 Plus. Provide a (or specify a builtin) emulator for the Z80, and other
hardware. You could then populate a blank machine with that definition.

Software like xpDBG then can use these machine definitions to support a wide
variety of hardware-types, without needing its developers to include specific
support for it. Someone who wants to debug a different, obscure hardware
platform with xpDBG wouldn't have much of a choice otherwise, because it's such
an obscure platform that no development teams have supported it. (or it's a new
platform that the person would have to develop the tools for themselves. )
Instead, they can just create a machine definition for this obscure hardware,
and use the machine definition with xpDBG. xpDBG doesn't have to include support
for this hardware, and the developers may never even know of it, but it can
still interface with, and accurately emulate, and work with, this hardware.
