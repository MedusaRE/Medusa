## What is Medusa?
Medusa (previously called xp<sup>DBG</sup>) is a project to create a cross
platform, free, and general purpose tool for software and hardware research,
like reverse engineering, analysis, emulation, development, debugging, and other
similar tasks.

All current software research tools have their own problems: Medusa is meant to
solve these issues.

For example:
- Cutter: not very featureful, essentially a radare2 GUI, doesn't have
  debugger and/or emulation support to my knowledge, and more.
- Ghidra: personal favorite currently, still doesn't have emulation support
  or code editing, and is written in Java (besides the decompiler), which is
  one of my least favorite languages.
- IDA (Pro): expensive, non-free, does not have emulation support,
  or code editing.
- Radare2: does not have code editing, a GUI, or the level of emulation support
  which I intend to include in Medusa.
- Binary Ninja: I honestly do not have a lot of experience with Binary Ninja,
  but to my knowledge, it is not free/open-source software, it isn't a full IDE
  (like Medusa is intended to be), and doesn't have emulation support (like
  Medusa is intended to). 

This list disregards the fact that, to my knowledge, none of those tools have
support for the sort-of hardware research I'd like to support in Medusa.

Planned features include:
- Support for multiple architectures (armv7, arm64, x86, x84-64, Z80, 6502, 68K,
  Java bytecode, etc. )
- Assembly editing
- C/C++ editing
- Assembling support for many architectures
- Compilation support for many architectures
- A debugger, with the ability to step forward and backward through
  instructions, view and modify registers, edit memory, scripting support,
  an API for writing things such as syscall handlers, and more.
- Both a GUI and TUI interface
- Scripting platform & network interface, Ã  la LLDB
- Support for many executable formats (Mach-O, ELF, PE, MZ, JAR, etc. )
- A disassembler to aid in reverse engineering
- Decompiler support (for example, [Ghidra](https://www.ghidra-sre.org)'s
  decompiler)
- and more!

## Installation
### Requirements
The exact commands necessary to install the requirements for Medusa will differ
based on the OS you are running, but in general, you will need to install:
- [`unicorn`](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn) (submodule available)
- [`capstone`](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone) (submodule available)
- [`keystone`](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone) (submodule available)
- [`doxygen`](https://doxygen.nl)
- [`GtkSourceView`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtksourceview) (submodule available)
- [`GtkSourceViewMM`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtksourceviewmm) (submodule available)
- `gtkmm3`
- `gtk3`
- `glade`
- `GIMP`
- `LaTeX`
- `python3`
- `Pillow`
- `Node`
- `npm`
- `badgen`

If you are running Arch Linux, or an Arch-based distro, such as Manjaro, you can
install all of the dependencies for Medusa by running `tools/deps_arch.sh` as
`root`.

### Compilation
To compile all Medusa components, `cd` into the Medusa folder (the parent folder
of this `README.md`), and type `make`. Assuming that all requirements are
installed, all components should be built, including:
- [`frontend`](/medusa_software/frontend)
- [`libmedusa`](/medusa_software/libmedusa)
- [`libxParse`](/medusa_software/libxparse)
- [`london`](/medusa_software/london)
- [`paris`](/medusa_software/paris)
- etc.

### Installing to your machine
As Medusa is not a finished project yet, there is not a way to fully install it
yet. The way that will probably be done is that after running `make`, you would
run `sudo make install`. Windows will likely have different steps, but I (spv)
am running GNU/Linux on my personal machine, not Windows, so I have not put much
work into Windows support yet. (at least for the `frontend`, other components
should be fine. )

## Donations
Lastly, I've (spv) been asked if I accept donations. I will place some wallet
addresses at the end of this section, but keep this in mind. I'm doing fine, and
there are probably organizations more deserving of your money than I am.
Consider donating to these organizations instead:
- [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/)
- [The Humane Society of The United States](https://www.humanesociety.org/)
- [Feeding America](https://www.feedingamerica.org/)
- [The American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org)
- [The Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org)
- More will be added to this list as I find charities I would like to
  support.

If, for some reason, you would still like to donate to me, here are some
cryptocurrency wallets you could donate to.
