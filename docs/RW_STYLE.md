# Reading/Writing Style
This is a document detailing the style of writing used in the Medusa project,
and how to read it.

For example: when 2 situations could apply to a sentence, you may see something
like this:

```
[a] machine (or machines) operate[s] the server(s)
```

The parantheses and square-brackets signify the 2 separate situations.

The above text means both of these situations:

```
a machine operates the server
```

and

```
machines operate the servers
```
