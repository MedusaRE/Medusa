# Commit Messages

The format for commit messages should roughly look like this:
`(component): (short description of the commit)`.

Don't make super big monster commits. (I'm (spv) guilty of that, lol. )

For example, if you fixed a bug in the Medusa frontend, an appropriate commit
message could be:
"frontend: fix buffer overflow in medusa_window constructor"

An inappropriate message could be:
"fix buffer overflow shit in frontend"

## Abbreviations
```
ms    - medusa_software
```

So, you could write your commit message as:
"ms/frontend: fix buffer overflow in medusa_window constructor"
