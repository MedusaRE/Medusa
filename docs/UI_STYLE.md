# GUI Style

This document will lay out general practices for GUI applications written by the
[Medusa Project](https://medusa-re.org).

## Fonts
For `monospace` fonts, use [`Inconsolata`](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/inconsolata).
I (spv) personally prefer [`Consolas`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/typography/font-list/consolas),
but as a proprietary font I don't believe that it is appropriate to use/require
it. Inconsolata is reasonably similar to Consolas, and is licensed under the SIL
Open Font License (OFL), so it is a free font.

[//]: # (      to check what font is used by default on my machine.)

For sans-serif variable width fonts, use [`Noto Sans`](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans).
