	\section{Introduction}
	\textit{Medusa} is a project to create a cross platform, free, and general
	purpose tool for software and hardware research, like reverse engineering,
	analysis, emulation, development, debugging, and other similar tasks. I
	started the \textit{Medusa} project originally under the name of
	\textit{xp\textsuperscript{DBG}}, as a hobby project to learn about reverse
	engineering, and because I felt that current development and reverse
	engineering tools all have their own problems, which I wanted to solve.
