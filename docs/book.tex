    Note: this document is written from the perspective of the Medusa Project's
    main developer, spv.

	\textit{Medusa} is a project to create a cross platform, free, and general
    purpose tool for software and hardware research, like reverse engineering,
    analysis, emulation, development, debugging, and other similar tasks. I
    started the \textit{Medusa} project originally under the name of
    \textit{xpDBG}, as a hobby project to learn about reverse engineering, and
    because I felt that current development and reverse engineering tools all
    have their own problems, which I wanted to solve.
