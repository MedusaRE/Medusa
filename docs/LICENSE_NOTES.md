# License Notes

I (spv) am not a fan of licensing the Medusa Project software under GPLv2+, as
I'm just not a fan of the possibility that the FSF could *hypothetically*
release a new version of the GPL that doesn't fit with the current goals of it.

As such, the Medusa Project software is currently licensed under version 2 of
the GPL, without the "any later version" clause. I am considering reviewing
version 3 of the GPL, and licensing the software under "version 2, or (at your
option), version 3".

I'd like to add a note to `README.md`, the license header, or something like
that along these lines:
```
In the case that it is legally possible to do so, Medusa can be licensed under
the Mozilla Public License (MPL) Version 2.0.

It may not be currently possible to do this due to licensing restrictions of,
say the GNU GPL, but in the future, if it is possible to license Medusa under
the MPLv2, treat it as such.
```
