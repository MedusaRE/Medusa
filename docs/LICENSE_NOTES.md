# License Notes

I (spv) am not a fan of licensing the Medusa Project software under GPLv2+, as
I'm just not a fan of the possibility that the FSF could *hypothetically*
release a new version of the GPL that doesn't fit with the current goals of it.

As such, the Medusa Project software is currently licensed under version 2 of
the GPL, without the "any later version" clause. I am considering reviewing
version 3 of the GPL, and licensing the software under "version 2, or (at your
option), version 3".
