Code Style

Medusa was originally going to be written in "C-Style C++". After learning more
about/of C++, and its standard library, I (spv) embrace more C++ features.

In general, make use of C++ stdlib functions and features when possible. (within
reason. )
For example, encouraged features include:
    std::string
    std::vector
    etc
Discouraged features include:
    streams
    (todo write more)

Put opening curly braces on the same line.
Write:
```
void blah(void) {
    bleh(bluh);
}
```
Not:
```
void blah(void)
{
    bleh(bluh);
}
```

Spaces after parenthesis and `if`-type keywords.
Write:
```
void blah(void) {
    if (bleh) {
        bluh();
    }
}
```
Not:
```
void blah(void) {
    if(bleh){
        bluh();
    }
}
```

This is partially to distinguish between real functions and builtin keywords,
I also think it just looks better.

4-spaces per tab. Use actual tabs, not spaces.
An exception is given for documentation, which I think should use spaces, as
GitHub defaults to 8 spaces per tab, and some other reasons I forget.
I prefer tabs instead of spaces usually because when using a CLI editor like
nano, soft tabs require more keyboard input to move through than hard tabs.
